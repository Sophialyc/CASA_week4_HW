## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#connect with repository
```{r}

#Load packages
```{r}

#read data
```{r}

# Edit column names
```{r}

HDIcols <- HDI %>%
  clean_names() %>% #clean column names - no spaces or capital letters
  select(iso3, country, gii_2019, gii_2010) %>% #selects specific columns
  mutate(difference = gii_2019 - gii_2010) %>% #creating a new column called difference, by taking the difference of the gii 2019 and gii 2010
  mutate(iso_code = countrycode(country, origin = 'country.name', destination = 'iso2c')) %>%
  mutate(iso_code2 = countrycode(iso3, origin ='iso3c', destination = 'iso2c'))
# taking either country/ iso3 and mutate it wo a 2 digit country code" iso2c --> 2 lines showing the same result
# can be done by st-replace since it is a string, but country code just works better and easier
```

# README msg is not always needed because it has three options when you dont add a readme
…or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# test" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sophialyc/test.git
git push -u origin main

…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sophialyc/test.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

…or import code from another repository
You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.

# paste the link e.g.(https://github.com/Sophialyc/test.git) into git panel--> setting --> shell
# this will connect a repository to rstudio, works the same as opening a new project and input the url

#Join HDI to world shp
```{r}

  clean_names() %>%
  left_join(., 
            HDIcols,
            by = c("iso" = "iso_code"))
```
OR
```{r}

  clean_names() %>%
  left_join(., 
            HDIcols,
            by = c("country" = "country"))
